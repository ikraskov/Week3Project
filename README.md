# UofTMapper
So far just an API request program
Given an address or Coodinates returns a link to an image of a google map 
around that location.
It can put location markers on any location within the map given either 
the coordinates for that location, its address, or name.
Can be turned into a satellite image or a roadmap like that of google maps
